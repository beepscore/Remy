## remy_python
Make a Python app with two parts:
- A Flask web service to accept television command requests (e.g. volume decrease, volume increase).
- A way to send commands to a transmitter, which then transmits the commands to the television (e.g. via infrared light). The app may run on a Raspberry Pi with an attached infrared transmitter and use LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control).
